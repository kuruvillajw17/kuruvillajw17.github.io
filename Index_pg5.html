        <div class="main"> <!--Main body text talking about how climate change is effecting earth and what we could do to help -->Climate change is a rapidly growing epidemic that can only be slowed via the changes we make today. If these changes are not made, many impacts will affect future generations. As the temperature swiftly increases overtime, the arctic ocean will begin to lose any ice that formed there. This effect will cause more damage then a loss of ice as sea levels will start to rise, causing entire cities to become submerged and destroyed.  According to NASA Global Climate Change, as the temperature increases more and more from that point, it is also likely that the winter season will no longer affect the earth's temperature as the world will have heated up significantly more. To conclude, if climate change is not prevented or slowed, the planet will sustain permanent damage that will cause many species to become extinct or rare, meaning any help now will possibly buy the time that scientists need to help and save the world.
