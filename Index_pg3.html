        <div class="main"><!--Main text talking about climate change and how it effects the earth -->Climate change has many effects on the surrounding environment, but trees have some of the main dangers towards them. One of the main effects that are a danger towards trees is fires, we have seen a rise in forest fires in recent times as the world has heated up. This causes many places to become polluted and become less clean. An added consequence to the fires is the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, trees occupy about 740 million acres of land just in the United States of America. With the world's climate changing rapidly, the trees and forests are at risk of dying. </div>
