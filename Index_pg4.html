        <div class="main">Oceans have lesser-known effect from climate change; they are not as announced as the other effects. The first effect is coral bleaching; coral bleaching is when coral is too hot, so the coral dies and fades to white. This means the other life living on the coral will have to move to survive, or they will die off affecting the ecosystem of the ocean. Another effect is ocean acidification which is where the sea will become acidic meaning many shell organisms will not be able to make a firm shell or any shell, further affecting the ecosystems around the ocean environment. According to the Environmental Disease Fund, the ocean absorbs up to 22 million tons of carbon dioxide per day. This is a massive amount for the sea only absorbing one-third of the carbon dioxide released per day.</div>
